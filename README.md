### Project Description:
The Meta Merge Tasker is a meta organisational app that will allow the user to achieve several tasks that would usually require several different apps and accomplish certain goals all in the one place. The app so will consist of 5 base features though in time this would be expanded to 8 or more. One of the main features of the app will be an expense manager that will allow the user to input the cost of recurring expenses, such as subscriptions, bills, BNPL payments etc and then give a total cost. Other key features of the application will be a list management system, password manager, password generator and an organiser. On top of these features additional features would be a document scanner, voice-to-text notes, as well as a companion web application that would allow the user to sync their information and access the same functions via their computer.
